# Final_Project
A collection of end-to-end deep learning & machine learning projects.
These projects showcase real-world applications using CNNs, NLP, computer vision, and Streamlit apps.
Projects Included
1. Emotion Detection from Facial Images
Goal: Predict human emotion (happy, sad, angry, etc.) from facial images.
Highlights:
Custom CNN + landmark MLP combining MTCNN face detection and MediaPipe Face Mesh
Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), weighted sampling, and early stopping
Deployed as a Streamlit app
Dataset: FER2013 Dataset
2. Plant Disease Detection
Goal: Detect plant leaf diseases from images using CNN & transfer learning.
Highlights:
Custom CNN & models like MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50
Data augmentation & evaluation
Deployed as a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction
Dataset: Kaggle - New Plant Diseases Dataset
